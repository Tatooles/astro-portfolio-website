title: "My Speedcubing Journey"
description: "My grandmother gave me a Rubik's Cube when I was in the fouth grade. I became determined to learn how to solve it. After learning how to solve it, I was unsatisfied and began to pursuit of solving the cube as fast as possible. Since then it's been a hobby that's dear to me, as well as a fun fidget toy."
