Speedcubing is something you've probably never heard of. It is the 'sport' of solving a Rubik's cube as fast as possbible. Currently the world record stands at an incredible 3.13 seconds set by Max Park in 2023. Yes you read that correctly. You can see it for yourself [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh8HX4itF_w).
